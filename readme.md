## Problem Statement

Instruction manuals for repairing complex machinery like vehicles are often difficult to understand and follow correctly. Important information is scattered over long documents with convoluted language. This leads to errors and decreased productivity. 

Our solution aims to simplify this process via an intelligent conversational assistant specifically customized for vehicle repair manuals.

## Proposed Solution  

We built Assembly Ally which supports mechanics by:

- Interpreting repair manual text, tables, diagrams
- Answering natural language questions 
- Summarizing relevant sections on demand
- Recommending next steps

This reduces time wasted searching manuals and improves work efficiency.
